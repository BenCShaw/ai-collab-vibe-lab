#AI-Collab Vibe Lab

Welcome to my first AI-collaborative coding journey** — a space where I’m learning to build, version, and evolve small projects with both human and AI support.

---

#Project Overview
This repository is the start of my long-term learning system for:
- Practicing collaborative AI-assisted coding  
- Learning Git, GitHub, and VS Code workflows  
- Building real projects from scratch and tracking my growth  

Current folder:

2025-11-02-hello-ai/

Contains my first script:  
*`hello-ai.py`** — prints a welcome message to kick off my journey.

#Tech Stack
- Python 3  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git + GitHub  

---

#Roadmap
- [ ] Add weekly AI-collaborative exercises  
- [ ] Learn to branch and merge cleanly  
- [ ] Integrate API-based experiments (OpenAI, Sui SDK, etc.)  
- [ ] Expand this lab into a portfolio of small, reproducible projects

#Lessons Learned (November 2025)

##Git Setup
Today was my first real test with Git and GitHub.  
I learned that even a single missing **“s” in `https://`** can break the remote connection — and fixing it means actually understanding how Git communicates between local and remote repos.

##Version Control Discipline
I learned how to:
- Initialize a repo from scratch  
- Stage and commit files properly  
- Fix author identity (avoid wrong usernames)  
- Rebase, resolve merge conflicts, and recover gracefully  

##Core Insight
Mistakes aren’t setbacks — they’re proof of growth.  
Every fix (missing HTTPS, bad remote, rebase conflict) is something real engineers face daily.  
Now I understand *why* Git is powerful — not just *how* to use it.

##Next Steps
- Add small Python utilities with clear commit messages  
- Start branching for experiments instead of overwriting `main`  
- Keep improving commit discipline and documentation habits
